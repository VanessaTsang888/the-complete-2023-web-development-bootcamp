247. The Mailchimp API - What You'll Make

We'll develop a one page Newsletter Sign Up web app.

Heroku makes it easy to deploy and scale Node.js apps. Run any recent version of Node.js Deploy apps in seconds using dependency caching.

I wish to set up my own online newsletter so I can email those who are interested in hearing from me, so i will develop a sign up page. Its single page site. The FE looks simple but the BE has some powerful functionality that will allow me to sign users up to my mailing list.

The special part of this site is that we not going to use localhost anymore but an actual HTTPS site and I can include the url in my socials such as Facebook.
