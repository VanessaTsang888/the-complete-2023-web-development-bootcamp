# The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp

[The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/)

An online training course on Udemy.

This is focused on Section 20. APIs > developing a Newsletter Login Webpage with a backend using the Mailchimp API to make the web app dynamic.

## The Tech Stack:

1. Node.js: a language for server-side development.
2. Express: a framework as it provides broad features for building web apps.
3. Nodemon: a library to get our changes updated in the background.
4. Boostrap to save us on some development time so we write less HTML allowing us to focus on Node.js development.
5. Mailchimp developer API: unfortunately, my Mailchip account is down and I am getting this fixed. This is why currently you will only reach the Failed web page and not the Successful web page hence why you will see the error code of 401 - unauthorised in the terminal or command line. However, the code is correct.
6. Heroku: a server to deploy our web app and make available to everyone on the World Wide Web. This is GoLive part of this project.

### To run this web app

To run this web app locally follow the below instructions;

1. Clone the repo down from GitHub.
2. Open the project in Code IDE.
3. Install node modules: `npm i`
4. Navigate to the directory called: newsletter-signup as this is where the node modules directory is located.
5. Use this command to launch the server using nodemon: `nodemon app.js`

### Testing

**_Manual Testing_**
You may wish to use Chrome Dev Tools to test this web app in the UI. From doing this you can see the error code which in the near future should be 200 as I'm currently getting my Mailchimp account unfrozen. Therefore, the error code will change from 401 to 200.

#### Next Up

When I get time I hope to do a couple of Quick Wins of this Node.js project and apply validate on the form to restrict certain characters being submitted by users - for cyber security reasons.
