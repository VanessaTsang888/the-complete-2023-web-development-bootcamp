# Node.js Training

For my Node.js training I used three of the sections from [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp Udemy training course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)

**Sections Used**  

1. Section 18: Node.js
2. Section 19: Express.js with Node.js
3. Section 20: APIs - Application Programming Interfaces.

## Weather Web App
As part of section 20, I develop a Weather web app for a user to input a city to find the weather condition for that city. The lectures I used to develop this dynamic and interactive Node.js app are:

- 239. Why Do We Need APIs?
- 240. API Endpoints, Paths and Parameters.
- 241. API Authentication and Postman.
- 242. What is JSON?
- 243. Making GET Requests with the Node HTTPS.
- 244. How to Parse JSON.
- 245. Using Express to Render a Website with Live API Data.
- 246. Using Body Parser to Parse POST Request to the Server.

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)


### Getting Started

- `git clone` the repository
- Navigate to the directory
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `nodemon app.js` to start the development server 

### Resources

- [Open Weather Map official website](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- I had registered for my own account on this website to generate my own API Key. Then I used this key in the app.js code file which is the Node Server.
- My code base has been pushed to my GitHub and the repository for that is: [Weather Web App](https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/the-complete-2023-web-development-bootcamp/tree/dev/S20-APIs/246-using-body-parser-to-parse-post)

All my code files for all the Node.js sections has been pushed to my [GitHub](https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/the-complete-2023-web-development-bootcamp/tree/dev)

### Quick Wins
These are improvements to the web app that I set to achieve after I have complete app by following the course instructor.
1. Code comments: write my own code comments to state the the logic for each block of code.
2. Code improvements: refactor my code to make my app more effient whilst still adhereing to the best practices.
3. Add more content to the app to state that i used a third party API and provide the resource to that.
4. Hosting: find an open source hosting platform and host this dynamic web app. Then provide the link to my team members and ask them for feedback.
