# Node.js Training

For my Node.js training I used three of the sections from [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp Udemy training course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)

**Sections Used**  

1. Section 18: Node.js
2. Section 19: Express.js with Node.js
3. Section 20: APIs - Application Programming Interfaces.

## Weather Web App
As part of section 20, I develop a Weather web app for a user to input a city to find the weather condition for that city. The lectures I used to develop this dynamic and interactive Node.js app are:

- 239. Why Do We Need APIs?
- 240. API Endpoints, Paths and Parameters.
- 241. API Authentication and Postman.
- 242. What is JSON?
- 243. Making GET Requests with the Node HTTPS.
- 244. How to Parse JSON.
- 245. Using Express to Render a Website with Live API Data.
- 246. Using Body Parser to Parse POST Request to the Server.

### Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)


### Getting Started

- `git clone` the repository
- Navigate to the directory
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `nodemon app.js` to start the development server 

### Resourcess

- [Open Weather Map official website](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- I had registered for my own account on this website to generate my own API Key. Then I used this key in the app.js code file which is the Node Server.
- My code base has been pushed to my GitHub and the repository for that is: [Weather Web App](https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/the-complete-2023-web-development-bootcamp/tree/dev/S20-APIs/246-using-body-parser-to-parse-post)

All my code files for all the Node.js sections has been pushed to my [GitHub](https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/the-complete-2023-web-development-bootcamp/tree/dev)


#### Next Up
In the future I hope to host this web app using GitHub pages so that my team member can use the web app and leave me feedback on my GitHub in the form of code review.
