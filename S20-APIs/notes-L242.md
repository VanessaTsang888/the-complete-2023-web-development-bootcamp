# 242. What is JSON

Javascript Object Notation.

The data our Postman return to us look similar to JS object > key-value-pairs, and separated by commas.
We can embed objects inside other objects.

## The differences

In JS we always declare a variable with a let, const or var at the start.
We have the name of the object (variable) without any quotation marks around it as its not a String.
The keys are never a String - without dbl quotes.
We use JSON to pass data around the internet as its a format that can be readable by human, and be easily collapsed down to take up as little space as possible.

### JSON Viewer Awesome

Chrome extension or add-on to add to my Chrome browser. This make JSON formated data pretty or more friendly to read.
I can't install this within my VM and I think I've been blocked from doing so?
