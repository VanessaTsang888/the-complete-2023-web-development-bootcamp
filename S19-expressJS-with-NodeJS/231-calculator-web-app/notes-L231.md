# 231. What We'll Make: A Calculator

We are going to develop a simple dynamic website that acts as a calculator.
This web app allows users to add two numbers and click the btn to return the result.
This is not a static website as we'll make a req to the server and the server sends back the css, the HTML, the JS files. The JS gets run in the client side when user loads up the webiste. However, this web app we going to make our code run on the server side. So our site makes a req to our server, its going to execute the code and only deliver the outcome back to the user, so user dont get to see any of the code and logic of our calculator - all done on our sever. This will improve performance of your apps so we can make more complex apps without performance issues. We'll be able to interact with DB's and query and search and manipulate our DB and create much more interesting web apps. This is the core concept we will use in next lessons.
