# 232 Calculator Setup Challenge

Before we start creating our Calculator website, we'll need to set up a new project. Follow the steps below using your Hyper Terminal to complete this challenge:

- Make a new folder called Calculator on your Desktop

- Change Directory to this new folder

- Inside the Calculator folder, create a new file called calculator.js

- Set up a new NPM package # initialise npm with `npm init`

- Open the project folder in Atom # I open mine in Code IDE instead.

- Using NPM install the express module: `npm install express`

- Require express in your calculator.js # done in the calculator.js

- Setup express # as above.

- Create a root route get method with app.get() # As above.

- Send the words Hello World from the root route as the response. # As above.

- Spin up our server on port 3000 with app.listen. # browser > localhost:3000

- Run server with nodemon to spin up our calculator.js # nodemon calculator.js

## Test in UI

I've used localhost:3000 and tested. I have the plain text of Hello world! printed out as expected. I means that I am listening on port 3000 my home route is working and I'm using express Express to do all that.
