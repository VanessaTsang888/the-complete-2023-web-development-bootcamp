# 242. What is JSON

Javascript Object Notation. This is the format of the data from the response I received from the request I sent within Postman.

The data our Postman return to us look similar to JS object > key-value-pairs, and separated by commas.
We can embed objects inside other objects. Can be easily turned back into JS objects.

## Other formats
XML: extensible markup language.
HTML: HyperText Markup Language.

## The differences

In JS we always declare a variable with a let, const or var at the start.
We have the name of the object (variable) without any quotation marks around it as its not a String.
The keys are never a String - without dbl quotes.
We use JSON to pass data around the internet as its a format that can be readable by human, and be easily collapsed down to take up as little space as possible.

### JSON Viewer Awesome

Chrome extension or add-on to add to my Chrome browser. This make JSON formated data pretty or more friendly to read.
I've instlled this now.

We can collapse parts of the tree to view certain data better.
